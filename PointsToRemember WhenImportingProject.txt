// When you adding your local project to git hub repository, make sure to add .project and .classPath files. 
// Because they holds the information about which Project Wizard the project belongs too.

// Add your git hub repository to git perspective.
// When trying to import the above repository, select Project Wizard and simple project.
// if you have .project and .classPath file, you dont get any errors.
// Since .project and .classPath have the project names



When you want to add/import a project which is in Git perspective to Java perspective, 
when doing so, import as a maven/grdle project. (just try)
but importing as a existing project also would work
